# Blurbify

This is code that will create little tweet like headings and stuff.
The idea is to use pillow.

I also need to create a website for this, blurbify.com

Use the dolphinoverlay.py as reference in pdf templates

### Future Libraries

CairoSVG
Pillow
OpenCV

Inkscape CLI

Right now I'm using OOP for the template but in the future I want to use JSON
